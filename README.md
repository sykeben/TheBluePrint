A simple webpage to print event information for FRC teams.

## Features

TheBluePrint allows you to print the following all from one spot:
- Event dates.
- Directions from your teams "home-base" to an event.
- Match schedules, including predicted times.
- QR codes for more information.

More features are being added whenever I get around to it.

## Instructions

To use TBP all you need is a team number and an event key. The event key is the little bit at the end of the url of BlueAlliance event pages (Hint: it's after `...event/` and starts with a year). In the future you should be able to select an event from a dropdown.
